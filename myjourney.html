        <h1 class="mjfirsttoppic">My Journey From Freshman to Graduate</h1>
        <h2 class="mjfirsttoppic2">This is the rough path I have planned for my life in CSTU.</h2>
        <h2 class="Freshman">Freshman</h2>
        <p class="mjparagraph">I try to study hard and do my best, learn more about the lessons, and join activities related to computer science to quickly learn about 
            my interests and strengths in order to further develop my future career.</p>
        <h2 class="Sophomore">Sophomore</h2>
        <p class="mjsecparagraph">If I know my own strengths, I will study them deeply and seriously for my future career. But I will also study other things to gain knowledge 
            in all areas and still study hard and maintain good grades.</p>
        <h2 class="Junior">Junior</h2>
        <p class="mjthirdparagraph">If I have the grades to get an internship, I will start looking for companies that need my skills and want me to intern. 
             I have to start looking seriously at going out to work because I will graduate in a year.</p>
        <h2 class="Senior">Senior</h2>
        <p class="mjforthparagraph">I hope that when I am in my 4th year, there will be a company that wants me to work with them. It will help me reduce the time it 
            takes to find a job after graduation, avoid unemployment problems, and have immediate income.</p>
